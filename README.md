# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built with Python's Turtle graphics module.

I made this project to practice object-oriented programming, event handling, and basic game logic in Python. The game includes score tracking, level progression, and a simple leaderboard system that saves your scores locally.

## Features

- Classic snake gameplay with smooth controls
- Speed increases as you level up and score more points
- High score is saved automatically between sessions
- Top 5 scores are tracked in a leaderboard
- Player name input at the start
- Clean, simple interface

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Run main.py
   

That's it! No extra libraries needed.

## How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to control the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- Eat the blue food to grow longer and score points
- Every 5 points you level up (up to level 5)
- The game gets faster as you level up and score more
- Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail
- After game over, choose whether to play again

## Future Ideas

Some things I might add later:
- Different difficulty modes
- Power-ups or obstacles
- Better graphics or themes
- Sound effects
- Pause functionality
