# Snake-Game

This is a classic Snake game built with Python and the Turtle graphics module.

I made this project to practice object-oriented programming, event handling, and basic game logic in Python. The game includes score tracking, level progression, a restart option, and a simple leaderboard system that saves scores locally.

## Features

- Classic snake movement and food system  
- Speed increases as you reach higher levels  
- Score and high score are saved automatically  
- Press "R" to restart the game without closing it  
- Player name input directly on the game screen  
- Simple leaderboard that keeps the top scores

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python(version 3) installed.  
2. Clone this repository:
3. Run the main.py file   

## File Overview

- **main.py** – Runs the main game loop  
- **snake.py** – Controls the snake’s behavior and movement  
- **food.py** – Manages food creation  
- **scoreboard.py** – Displays and updates score  
- **leaderboard.py** – Saves and displays top scores  
- **highscore.txt** – Stores best score (auto-created)  
- **scores.json** – Stores leaderboard data (auto-created)


## Notes

- The game window is 600x600 pixels.     
- Use arrow keys to control the snake.   
- The game ends if the snake touches the wall or itself.   
- The leaderboard keeps your recent high scores in scores.json.
